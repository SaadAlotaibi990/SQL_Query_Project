# SQL_Query_Project

First think i had to do in this project is to ask some questions about the data and then after that i did my SQL query. 

1 - 1st question: what are the Top 10 Albums with the most songs?
2 - 2nd question: what are the Top 10 Sales and order them by Genre
3 - 3rd question: what are the top 10 average number of minutes for different genres
4 - 4th question: what are the Numbers of Sales by Media Type

I uploaded a PDF of the visualizations and a text file with the queries if you're interested.
